# LocalCloud

> Transform your laptop into a powerful AI workstation in seconds

LocalCloud is a revolutionary platform that turns any machine into a fully-featured AI development environment. Deploy chat interfaces, RAG systems, and custom AI workflows with a single command - no cloud dependencies, no recurring costs, no data leaving your machine.

## Vision

**Make AI development as simple as running a local web server.**

LocalCloud bridges the gap between complex AI infrastructure and developer productivity. We believe every developer should be able to prototype, build, and deploy AI applications locally without wrestling with complex setups or sending sensitive data to third parties.

## Features

ðŸš€ **One-Command Setup**: Install and run complete AI stacks instantly  
ðŸ”’ **Privacy First**: Your data never leaves your machine  
ðŸ’° **Zero Recurring Costs**: No cloud bills, ever  
ðŸŽ¯ **Pre-built Templates**: Chat, RAG, API endpoints ready to customize  
âš¡ **Optimized for Laptops**: Efficient 4GB RAM models that actually work  
ðŸ”§ **Developer Friendly**: Full source access, extensible architecture  

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install LocalCloud
curl -fsSL https://install.localcloud.dev | sh
